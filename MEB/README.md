'brain' folder is the MEB base project folder.
During the build stage Corbos Studio will be pointing to this directory as it's base - as it also expects the name 'brain' - the same name of the service.
Please make sure CMakeLists.txt exists in this folder during compilation.
Mind the difference between 'brain' folder as a root folder MEB, and 'brain' folder
